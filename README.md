# Spam Email Detector

A machine learning project that **detects whether an email is spam or ham (not spam)** with a **percentage of certainty**. Built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Scikit-learn**, this project utilizes natural language processing and deep learning to classify emails based on their content.

# Features

-  Classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham**
-  Returns **confidence score** (percentage certainty)
-  Built using a **Neural Network** model
-  Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text to numerical data
-  Includes **data preprocessing**, model training, and prediction

# Technologies Used

-  Python
-  TensorFlow & Keras
-  Pandas & NumPy
-  Scikit-learn (`TfidfVectorizer`, `train_test_split`)
